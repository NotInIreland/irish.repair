                        <h6>The HP-35s is a programmable scientific calculator from Hewlett-Packard. It was introduced in 2007 for the 35th anniversary of the HP-35. <br><br> I personally wanted to get one because it is the only programmable calculator allowed on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam and because it uses Reverse Polish Notation. <br><br> This is one of my endgame calculators and took me some time to find at a fair price. They aren’t super rare, but they often sell for $300+ and that was way more than I was willing to pay. Fortunately I was able to find one for significantly less and that's the model I have today.</h6>
