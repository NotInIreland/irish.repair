                        <h6>Being one of the most notable Texas Instrument models that is still produced today, the TI-83 Plus does practically everything that its newer counterparts can do despite the design being from the late 90s. <br><br> My first graphing calcualtor, I got it from my father after being tired of the simple scientific calcualtor I was using in school. He got his when he was in High School and it was manufactued in Feburary of 1999, so It's a very early model.<br><br> Not the most special calcualtor, but it's a lovely one and it's the model that got me into calculators. While I never used it properly untli later in my schooling, It was still so much nicer to use than the basic scientifcs my peers had.</h6>
